Course Material and FAQ for the Ultimate React Course
This branch of the repo contains starter files and final code for all sections and projects of the course, exactly as shown in the videos.

Use starter code to start each section, and final code to compare it with your own code whenever something doesn't work!

ðŸš¨ Please read the following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) carefully before starting the course ðŸš¨

FAQ
Q1: How do I download the files?
A: If you just want to download the entire code, click the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option. If you can't see the button (on mobile), use this link instead.

Q2: I'm stuck! Where do I get help?
A: Have you tried to fix the problem on your own? Have you compared your code with the final code? Are you using the library versions as indicated in the course videos? If you failed fixing your problem, please post a detailed description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy, along with a link to a codesandbox containing your code.

Q3: Can I see a final version of the course projects?
A: Sure! Here you go:

Pizza Menu (Components, props, JSX)
Travel List (useState and state management)
Eat-n-split (Practice project)
usePopcorn (useEffect, data fetching, custom hooks)
Classy weather (Class components)
Quiz App (useReducer)
WorldWise (React Router, context API, memo, useMemo, useCallback)
Fast React Pizza (React Router data loading, Redux, Redux Toolkit, thunks, Tailwind CSS)
The Wild Oasis (React Query, Styled Components, React Hook Form, Supabase, advanced compound component pattern, authentication, charts, dark mode, professional application planning and development)
The Wild Oasis Website (Next.js "app" router, React Server Components, server actions, authentication with NextAuth)
Q4: What VSCode theme are you using?
A: I use One Monokai in this course. For the icons, I'm using Material Icon Theme.

Q5: Videos don't load, can you fix it?
A: Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about it. The course is hosted on Udemy, and sometimes they have technical issues. Please just come back a bit later or contact their support team.

Q6: Videos are blurred / have low quality, can you fix it?
A: Please open video settings and change the quality from 'Auto' to another value, for example 720p. If that doesn't help, please contact the Udemy support team.

Q7: Are videos downloadable?
A: Videos used to be downloadable, but unfortunately, Udemy has disabled video downloads on all my courses in order to fight piracy. There is nothing I can do about this.

Q8: I want to put these projects in my portfolio. Is that allowed?
A: Absolutely! Just make sure you actually built them yourself by following the course, and that you understand what you did. What is not allowed is that you create your own course/videos/articles based on this course's content!

Q9: I love your courses and want to get updates on new ones. How?
A: First, you can subscribe to my email list at my website. Plus, I make important announcements on twitter @jonasschmedtman, so you should definitely follow me there ðŸ”¥

Q10: How do I get my certificate of completion?
A: A certificate of completion is provided by Udemy after you complete 100% of the course. After completing the course, just click on the "Your progress" indicator in the top right-hand corner of the course page. If you want to change your name on the certificate, please contact the Udemy support team.

Q11: Can you add subtitles in my language?
A: No. I provide professional English captions, but Udemy is responsible for subtitles in all other languages (automatic translations). So please contact the Udemy support team to request your own language.

Q12: Do you accept pull requests?
A: No, because this repository should contain the exact same code that is shown in the videos. However, feel free to add an issue if you found one.
